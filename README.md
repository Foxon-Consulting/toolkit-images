# Introduction

Each toolkit image has its own folder containing the following files:
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml example to run it
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md generated by release-please

## How to build

To build an image:

```sh
docker build -t foxonconsulting/IMAGE_NAME:TAG .
```

with:
- IMAGE_NAME: the image name
- TAG: the version of the image

## How to run
You can use the docker-compose.yml provided as example.

Provide correct path to map the volume for:
- local repository
- ssh key (for ansible). Allow to access the target VM.
- aws configuration files (for terraform on aws).

## How to contribute

To add a new environment image:
- Create a directory
- Add a Dockerfile, a README.md and a docker-compose.yml
- Add it to .release-please-manifest.json and release-please-config.json
- Add it into .github/workflows/standard.yml (directory name into the matrix)
